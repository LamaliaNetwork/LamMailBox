mailings:
  # === COMMON FIELDS ===
  # enabled: true/false toggle for the mailing.
  # type: FIRST_JOIN | REPEATING
  #   FIRST_JOIN  -> fires when a player joins for the first time (per UUID).
  #   REPEATING   -> follows the cron schedule defined under schedule.cron.
  # message: The text stored in the mail body (supports color codes like &a).
  # sender: Name shown as the mail sender (defaults to "Console" if omitted).
  # receiver: Target spec (player name, semicolon list, "all", etc.). Defaults to "all".
  # required-permission: Optional permission node players must have to receive the mail.
  # expire-days: Optional integer; how many days until the mail auto-expires (null = config default).
  # items: List of item directives converted directly into ItemStacks (supports namespace ids).
  # commands: Console commands executed when the mail is claimed (supports %player% placeholder).
  # command-items: Preferred way to define console actions; each entry mirrors the GUI command bundles
  #                (material, display name, lore, commands, custom-model-data) and is shown in the mail view.
  #                `custom-model-data` is optional and lets you match resource-pack overrides.
  # schedule:
  #   For FIRST_JOIN:
  #     delay-minutes / delay-seconds (optional) -> wait before delivering after first join.
  #   For CRON:
  #     cron: UNIX cron expression "m h dom mon dow" (required).
